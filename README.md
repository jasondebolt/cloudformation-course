Introduction to CloudFormation

This is my first AWS CloudFormation course. 

### Overview (5 minutes)
* About me
* This course is for anyone interested in learning about or using CloudFormation for AWS automation.
* I value my time, and I value yours as well. This is a hightly focused course on CloudFormation, not AWS.
* This means that I will discuss as few AWS services as possible to keep the focus on CloudFormation.
* All that is needed to complete this course is an AWS account and a browser (display graphic). No command line or coding skills are required.
* As a final project, we'll create and deploy an S3 static website.
* without further ado, let's get started.

### Prerequisites (2 minutes)
* Create an AWS account

#### Create the most basic CloudFormation stack (5 minutes)
* CloudFormation is made up of stacks. Stacks are a set of useful things in AWS, like S3 buckets and EC2 instances. We call these useful things "resources" in CloudFormation. All CloudFormation stacks must have at least 1 resource. 
* CloudFormation resources can be created, updated, and deleted.
* Create a stack.
* Update the stack.
* Delete the stack.
* Create the stack again.
* Add a file to the bucket.
* Try deleting the stack.
* Delete the file from the bucket.
* Delete the stack.
